One day a human went looking for a list of land-grant universities and their domains. The human was able to easily find this information, but they could not easily obtain the information in machine-readable format. The human was sadly forced to scrape multiple pages and create their own csv. The human said that "this should be easy to find as a dataset, but I suppose it's too boring* to be of interest." The cat did not respond, and Boring Datasets was born. 




\* Due to its subjective nature, we do not take responsibility for datasets that others may find _interesting_.
